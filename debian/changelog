  * Some minor improvements in rosbag2_storage_mcap after review (#58 <https://github.com/ros-tooling/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/58>)
    1. Fixed some findings from Clang-Tidy

    1. Add default initializations for member variables
    1. Moved code responsible for adding schema and channel from write(msg)

    message write and in lieu to preparation for moving schema collection
    process to upper SequentialWriter layer.

  * [1.0.0] Use Summary section for get_metadata() and seek(), implement remaining methods (#17 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/17>)
  * feat: add play impl (#16 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/16>)
  * chore: refine package.xml (#15 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/15>)
  * Don't throw when READ_WRITE mode is used; add .mcap file extension to recorded files (#14 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/14>)
    I may be missing something, but from a cursory glance at [this code](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/blob/342d8ed3c1c4ae0411a4a92b60e79a728b8974b8/rosbag2_storage/src/rosbag2_storage/impl/storage_factory_impl.hpp#L108-L135), it appears that the APPEND mode is never used. This means we need to support READ_WRITE.
    This also adds a .mcap extension to recorded file names.
  * Add dynamic message definition lookup (#13 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/13>)
    Currently, an exception will be thrown if lookup fails.
  * Switch C++ formatter to clang-format (#12 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/12>)
    Remove uncrustify linter in favor of clang-format, which is easier to configure for use in VS Code format-on-save.
